### Regression with XGBoost and MLib pipelines

This notebook uses a bike-sharing dataset to illustrate MLlib pipelines and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The challenge is to predict the number of bicycle rentals per hour based on the features available in the dataset such as day of the week, weather, season, and so on. Demand prediction is a common problem across businesses; good predictions allow a business or service to optimize inventory and to match supply and demand to make customers happy and maximize profitability.
